What makes a good hash function?

- Fast (We have to calculate the hash value whenever we retrieve or add data so it needs to be in constant time)

- Deterministic - Same input gives the same output

- Distributed - Cluttered output is not preferred

How to handle collisions?

- Separate Chaining
- Linear Probing
